# Beware All Ye Who Enter...

If you enter this code, you will discover wonders beyond your wildest imagination, and also the most monstrous horrors of your nightmares.

Be wary. Do not trust what you see, for it may be a phantasm intent on devouring your very soul.

Tread carefully, for there are devious, and deadly traps that will keep you ensnared until your very wits are lost... or your life.

## Tips

* This is truly a playground for me to try the latest features of JavaScript, you may want to run this application in Chrome Canary or Firefox Developer Edition if you find that it won't work in the production releases of Chrome and Firefox.

* Load the project and type in the following commands, one at a time, in the developer console.

    ```
    Gauntlet.help('s');
    Gauntlet.help('w');
    Gauntlet.help('m');
    ```

* If you want to run a battle directly in the developer tools console panel, just add `/?console=true` to end of the URL.
